Create a new project called MyDuka with the following files: -main.py -database.py

Open up a new terminal and run the following commands:

pip install flask
pip install psycopg2-binary
TABLES -> Products , Sales , Stock, Users Open sql shell create a new database create database myduka; connect to myduka d. atabase \c myduka

run the following commands

products table CREATE TABLE products ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, buying_price NUMERIC(20, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (buying_price >= 0), selling_price NUMERIC(20, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (selling_price >= 0) );

stock table CREATE TABLE stock ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, pid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, stock_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (stock_quantity >= 0), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

sales table CREATE TABLE sales ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, pid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

users CREATE TABLE users ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE, phone_number VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL );

pip -> pip installs packages

Psycopg2 -> A database driver or adapter used to connect Python to a Postgres database -> To estabish this connection , we use a function called psycopg2.connect() -> which takes some parameters important for establishing a db connection

psycopg2.connect() - a function used to establish a new connection to a postgres db -> It takes some arguments: 1.host - on what server is my database located? - host = 'localhost' localhost : my own device -> database is locally hosted on my device

2.port -> where in my device is the Postgres service running -> Postgres runs on port 5432 by default port = '5432' 3.user - username attached to a Postgres user user = 'postgres' 4.password - password attached to a Postgres user for login password = '1234' 5.dbname - the database you intend to connect to dbname = 'myduka'

127.0.0.1 build an app -> deploy it on cloud to make it available online -> an ip address is assigned to your application

179.181.200.120 domain name -> a human friendly name attached to an ip address https://meet.google.com/dsh-idtb-oqb

cur - an object / tool for performing database operations db operations - select , insert , update , delete

C - create - insert R - read. - select U - update. - update D - delete - delete

cur.execute() - a function used to execute sql queries cur.fetchall() - a function used to retrieve data from Postgres to Python

insert into products(name, buying_price,selling_price)values('bread',50,60); insert into products(name, buying_price,selling_price)values('milk',50,60);

our data format - a list of tuples

Task

insert two record of sales in sql shell and use psycopg2 to display them in your terminal

brush up on the following concepts: -> SQL ( sql queries , joins , aggregate functions , group by) -> Python ( data types, lists and tuples , for loops, if statements & functions) w3schools & geeks for geeks

Inserting data using psycopg2 insert into table_name(columns....)values(...) conn.commit() - a function meant to commit / save db changes

Optimize our queries in psycopg2 using functions -> Functions : block of reusable code meant to perform a specifc task

why use functions? 1.Reusability - use parameters parameters & arguments 2.Modularity - breaking code into smaller manageable pieces 3.Better readability 4.Code Organization 5.Scalability 6.Better debugging

transactions - more than one query executing as a single unit of work

sql injection select email,password from users where password = 1 OR 1 == 1 1 OR 1 == 1

Task 1.Using functions write code to: -> get_stock() -> insert sales() -> insert_stock()

2.Write sql queries that fetch the following data: -> sales_per_day -> profit_per_day -> sales_per_product -> profit_per_product


15000 * 3 = 45000 (quantity , selling_price , date)

sales per day select date(sales.created_at) as date, sum(sales.quantity * products.selling_price) as total_sales from sales join products on products.id = sales.pid group by date;

profit per day select date(sales.created_at) as date, sum(sales.quantity *( products.selling_price - products.buying_price)) as total_sales from sales join products on products.id = sales.pid group by date;

sales per product select products.name as p_name , sum(sales.quantity * products.selling_price) as total_sales from products join sales on sales.pid = products.id group by p_name;

profit per product select products.name as p_name , sum(sales.quantity *( products.selling_price - products.buying_price)) as total_sales from products join sales on sales.pid = products.id group by p_name;

Multiline strings ->Enable you to have a string that spans more than one line -> it uses tripple opening & closing brackets

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING - OOP -> Broadly we have 2 categories of data types: 1.Inbuilt data types -> data types that come with the programming language -> str, int, float ,bool , lists , tuples... 2.Custom data types -> data types created by the programmer -> this is useful in representing data outside the predefined data types -> This is enabled by OOP (use of classes and objects)

OOP - a programming paradigm where we build programs around classes and objects Class - a template / blueprint for creating objects Object - an instance of a class

Any class has the following 3 things: 1.Identity - every class has a unique name to identify it e.g class Laptop, class Dog 2.State : variables / data / attributes contained in a class =>variables : what does a class have? 3.Behaviour : what can a class do? -> enabled by functions functions inside a class are called methods

class Laptop: identity : Laptop state: ram , processors ,e.t.c behaviour : power on, power off, code, create files

generate identity,state and behaviour for the following classes: 1.Horse 2.Student 3.Car

class Student: identity : Student state: name , student_no , course , age behaviour : learn, sleep, eat, do_exams

class Horse : identity : Horse state : name, age , breed , can_race behaviour: run , race, sleep, eat

Method - any function inside a class Constructor - a special method that is automatically called when creating an object. It is used to initialize objects with data ->def init()

dunder methods - double underscore methods

self - refers to the object being created

Behaviour - what can a class do? -> defined by functions(methods)

TASK 1.Create a class called BankAccount with the attributes: - account number , balance , owner name , date opened
2.Add some behaviour to the above class using the methods: - deposit() - withdraw() - check_balance() -display_info() -close_account()
3.Create two BankAccount objects that can deposit , withdraw , check balance display info and close account
